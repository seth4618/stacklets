Parallel programming has always been hard either due to lack of the inherent
parallelism or due to the excessive overhead involved in communication and
synchronization among the processors. In this paper we deal with the latter
case, where we implement and evaluate a lazy thread initialization that makes
sure to create parallel threads only when necessary. We reduce the 
synchronization overhead by using User level interrupts thereby removing the 
traditional User-Kernel mode switch. To this end, we implement the Stacklet
mechanism, where the thread stacks form a cactus stack andevaluate this 
implementation using Gem5. We evaluate our implementation using Gem5 simulator
with Cilk benchmarks and also some micro benchmarks.
