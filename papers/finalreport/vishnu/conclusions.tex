\section{Conclusions}

Ths usage of stacklets and user-level interrupts shows significant results
that eliminates excessive parallelism. By reducing the synchronization and
communication among the cores, we can now concentrate on exploiting the
parallel nature of the programs. The User level interrupts mechanism shows
that just by adding a very small number of instructions, we can reduce the
effect of user-kernel switch for future user-level device drivers. This would
make the debugging of user drivers much more easier as they are in the user
mode. By just adding some insructions to the architecure,a couple of registers
and a tiny bit of memory for stacklet handlers, the lazy thread creation with 
user-level interrupts could open new ways of exploting parallelism.
