Instead of increasing the frequency of the CPU, exploiting multicore architecture's ability for faster computation has been a trend. In this paper, we propose using user level interrupts (ULI), to help solve two major problems in multicore architecture - excessive parallelism and locking contention. We design ULI APIs and simulate these APIs through Gem5. With the help of ULI, we implement lazy thread to prune extra parallelism and propose two lock schemes.
