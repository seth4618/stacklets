\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we proposes a multicore design and implementation for user level interrupts. We add TOGGLEULI, SETUPULI, SENDI, GETCPUID, and RETULI as new assembly instructions. We simulate these instructions in Gem5 to demonstrate the feasibility. Using ULI, we implement two lock schemes and lazy thread. We also show benchmark results on these two use cases for ULI.
