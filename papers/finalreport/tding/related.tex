\section{Related Work}

This work is an extension of Goldstein et al.'s work, which first brings upon the notion of lazy threads to reduce excessive parallelism by creating parallel calls when needed. Our work makes use of ULI to realize the work stealing mechanism, such that some idle cores could send interrupt to acquire jobs from other cores. Parker analysed a case of user-level interrupts for high-speed I/O devices, so that latency spent in kernel can be eliminated.
