\section{Conclusions}
This paper introduces user-level interrupt and several additional instructions. Then we use it to turn eager parallel calls into parallel-ready sequential calls in order to reduce unnecessary parallelism. In addition, we also introduce two ULI-based locks to demonstrate the benefits we get using ULI to achieve synchronizations. We use Gem5 to implement our new architecture and simulate these instructions. Then we evaluate and compare our work over several parallel Cilk programs and other kinds of locks to show respective performance gains.
