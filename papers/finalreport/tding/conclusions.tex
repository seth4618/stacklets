\section{Conclusions}
This paper introduces user-level interrupt and with necessary instructions. We have demonstrated turning eager parallel calls into parallel-ready sequential calls using ULI in order to reduce unnecessary parallelism. In addition, we also introduce two ULI-based queuing locks to achieve efficient synchronizations. To simulate our architecture, we use Gem5 as our platform and deploy our working-stealing mechanism as well as testing suites. Then we evaluate and compare our work to several parallel Cilk programs and other kinds of locks to show our respective performance gains.
