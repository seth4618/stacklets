Multicores are becoming increasingly important because power constraints prevent
denser, hence faster cores.  This calls for writing efficient parallel
programs. However, there are challenges involved in doing so. We explore the
usefulness of User Level Interrupts in addressing two of the challenges in this
paper.  Them being, synchronization among parallel threads and prevention of
excessive parallelism through parallel ready sequential calls. We use ULIs to
implement two locking schemes and to detect stacklet overflow in the
implementation of parallel ready sequential calls. We evaluate our locking
implementation on Gem5 and on baremetal against other locking schemes.  ABSTRACT
