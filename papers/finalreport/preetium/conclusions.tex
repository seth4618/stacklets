\section{Conclusions}

This paper demonstrates how ULIs have the potential to transfer complete control
over to userspace in the areas of synchronization and memory management of
userspace applications. It opens doors for exploring and evaluating more areas
where ULIs can be used. It also highlights the importance of parallel ready
sequential calls in today's sytems. The simulation of ULIs on Gem5 and on
baremetal brings forth challenges encountered while evaluating architectural
changes.
