\section{Conclusions}
With very few architectural modifications (that can easily be done in any of
today's modern multi-core architectures), we present a convincing case of
adopting user-level interrupts in order to reduce the overhead of bouncing
between the userspace and kernel space and thus avoiding costly setup and
teardown involved in processing exlusively kernel-space interrupts.
