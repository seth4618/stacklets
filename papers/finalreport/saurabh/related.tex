\section{Related Work}
Jaleel et al. \cite{jaleel2006line} performed an interesting experiment of
inlining interrupt handler of the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), one of the
most commonly occuring interrupts in the system, into the reorder buffer along
with other currently executing instructions. They found out that inlining the
interrupts reduced the cost of handling the interrupt significantly as they
avoided the costly draining of the pipeline. Our completely user-level locking
mechanism is inspired from the MCS lock \cite{mellor1991synchronization}.
Stacklets originally were proposed by Goldstein et al. \cite{goldstein} where
they developed the parallel-ready sequential call in order to efficiently
utilize the existing parallelism.
