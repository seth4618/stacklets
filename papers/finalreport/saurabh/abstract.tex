Programming for parallelism has always been extremely hard. Moreover, when the
underlying degree of parallelism changes because of technological advancements,
the existing parallel programs, on several occasions need to be changed to
exploit fully the newly added power. Stacklets provide a convenient abstraction
by introducing a parallel-ready sequential call to only invoke as much
parallelism as is supported by the underlying architecture. Stacklets need to
support significantly low-cost interrupt handling capavbilities to realize
their full potential. Another interrupt-heavy operation in multi-core systems
is synchronization.  In this work, we explore the power of user-level
interrupts in multi-core architectures to reduce the costly user-kernel
transition on every interrupt by handling it in user-space itself. Our
experiments are aimed at speeding up stacklets and synchronization by having a
completely user-space variant of the MCS lock.
