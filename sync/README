Locking library:
---------------

This folder contains the code that implements locking using user level
interrupts.

make -f Makefile_lib produces uli.so which can be linked to any application
using it.

Microbenchmark: 
--------------

myapp.c does a simple concurrent increment of counter using our locking
implementation. This can be changed to any other lock for comparision.

make builds the myapp benchmark.

Simulation: 
-----------

If you have simulated user level interrupts, #define SIM_ULI in u_interrupt.h,
and change the macro definitions of DUI,EUI and SENDI to call your simulated
functions.  Compile using make -f Makefile_lib.
